     * - Drivers include Mysql Postgres Sqlite Sqlserver
     *   See vendor\cakephp\cakephp\src\Database\Driver for complete list
     * - Do not use periods in database name - it may lead to error.
     *   See https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/6471 for details.
     * - 'encoding' is recommended to be set to full UTF-8 4-Byte support.
     *   E.g set it to 'utf8mb4' in MariaDB and MySQL and 'utf8' for any
     *   other RDBMS.
